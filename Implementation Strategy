Project Plan:

Coming up with multiple statistical strategy which beat the market benchmark set by the untrade client.
Combination of these models in the following way.

All the model will be giving signals to a controlling model, which will be recieving the signals from the market regime model.

Based on the market regime model's input data, this controlling model will dynamically change the weights being given to each of the model, and then the final signal will be generated by a threshold value trained on the historical data.
